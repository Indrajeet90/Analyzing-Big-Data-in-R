# Analyzing Big Data in R
R is a popular statistical programming language with a number of extensions that support data processing and machine learning tasks. However, interactive data analysis in R is usually limited as the runtime is single-threaded and can only process data sets that fit in a single machineâ€™s memory. This poses a problem to analyze Big Data.

In Analyzing Big Data in R using Apache Spark, you will learn how to combine R with Spark and take advantage of this powerful language to analyze Big Data. SparkR provides a distributed data frame API that enables structured data processing with a syntax familiar to R users.
